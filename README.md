# Sandbox CLI

There's really nothing interesting here other than the [bitbucket-pipelines.yml](bitbucket-pipelines.yml) for syncing this repository from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/rickatfw/sandbox-cli) to [GitHub](https://github.com/rherrick/sandbox-cli). This is described in more detail in [Bitbucket to GitHub sync](bb-to-gh-sync.md).
